<!-- ## Beier Zhu (朱贝尔)
       
<br/><br/> -->
**Experience**: I’m Beier Zhu (朱贝尔), currently a Research Fellow in the [MReaL Lab](https://mreallab.github.io/) at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), working with [Prof. Hanwang Zhang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/hanwangzhang/). I obtained my PhD degree from [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), supported by the prestigious [AISG PhD](https://aisingapore.org/research/phd-fellowship-programme/) programme. Prior to that, I received my B.E. and M.E. degrees from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2016 and 2019, respectively.

**Research**: My research focuses on developing robust machine learning algorithms with strong theoretical foundations, with particular interests in imbalanced learning, group robustness, out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and fairness. On the application side, I am also interested in understanding and leveraging large multimodal models—such as Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and Stable Diffusion—for solving downstream tasks.
